{ID:uml-1}
{QUESTION: What are the two main types one one subtype of uml diagrams?}
{ANSWER: structure, behavior and interaction is subtype of behavior}
{ID:uml-structure-1}
{QUESTION: Name the seven UML structure diagrams.}
{ANSWER: Package, Class, Object, Component, Composite, Collaboration, Deployment}
{ID:uml-behavior-1}
{QUESTION: Name the 3 UML behavior diagrams and the one subtype}
{ANSWER: Activity, Use Case, State and subtype Interaction}
{ID:uml-interaction-1}
{QUESTION: Name the 4 types of UML interaction diagrams}
{ANSWER: Sequence, Timing, Communications, Interaction Overview}
{ID:uml-2}
{QUESTION: How many uml digrams are there?}
{ANSWER: Around 14 give or take.}
{ID:uml-structure-2}
{QUESTION: Describe the structure Package diagram}
{ANSWER: Shows package grouping of classes usually in a symbol that looks like a folder 
with tab. Packages can implement an inteface or package. Dashed lines with arrows
shows dependencies. A package symbol can be nested within a package symbol.}
{ID:uml-structure-3}
{QUESTION: Describe the structure Class diagram.}
{ANSWER: Have boxes that represent classes with name, properties which
are attributes and opeartions. Various association lines with different arrows
show how classes interelate. Keywords can describe things. Multiplicity is where
thee is 0, 0..#, 0..* or 1..#, 1..* etc.}
{ID:uml-structure-4}
{QUESTION: Describe the structure Object diagram.}
{ANSWER: Snapshot of objects in a system at a point in time. Boxes that show obectname:classname and
name=value for fields or data.}
{ID:uml-structure-5}
{QUESTION: Describe the structure Component diagram.}
{ANSWER:Use a box with symbol that looks like a plug. Also use assocition lines with round ciricle in 
half circle socket. Can be nested. Use :somename[value] in box. May have ports or squares on sides where 
connectors come in. Similar to composite.}
{ID:uml-structure-6}
{QUESTION: Describe the structure Composite diagram.}
{ANSWER: Uses box with lolipop lines connecting to box or half ciricle lolipops connection to box.
Circle lolipops are controls and half circle are input/output. These boxes can be nested and there
maybe be control flow association lines called connectors. May have little squares on the sides of
box called ports. Similar to Component}
{ID:uml-structure-7}
{QUESTION: Describe the structure Collaboration diagram}.
{ANSWER: Collaboration is UML 1. Mostly boxes with associations and mutipliticy.
Has no flow or arrows and a dashed circle or lines that show collaboration occurance.
Boxes name roles. }
{ID:uml-structure-8}
{QUESTION: Describe the structure Deployment diagram.}
{ANSWER: These diagrams show communications paths between parts of a system. And show the 
parts of the system in a 3d box for hardware and other or 3d cylinder for data stores. They can
show artifacts like executables, and containers or execution enviroments. Also 
deployment files and operating systems.}
